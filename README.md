This repository contains code for two assignments related to reading and converting 3D geometry files:

1. **STL to OBJ Converter**: Here, the code converts STL files into OBJ format and stores the output into an OBJ file.

2. **OBJ to STL Converter**: This assignment deals with converting OBJ files into STL format and storing the output into an STL file.

## Instructions for Usage

1. **STL to OBJ Converter**:
   - Run the `stl_to_obj_converter.cpp` file.
   - Specify the path to the STL file you want to convert.
   - The code will convert the STL file into OBJ format and save the output into an OBJ file.

2. **OBJ to STL Converter**:
   - Execute the `obj_to_stl_converter.cpp` file.
   - Input the path to the OBJ file you want to convert to STL.
   - The program will convert the OBJ file into STL format and save the output into an STL file.
