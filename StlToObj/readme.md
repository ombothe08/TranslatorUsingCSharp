# STL to OBJ Converter

This program converts STL files into OBJ format and saves the output into an OBJ file.

## Description

This assignment deals with converting STL files into OBJ format and storing the output into an OBJ file. The converter takes the path to the STL file as input, converts it into OBJ format, and saves the resulting OBJ file. The conversion process involves parsing the STL file to extract vertex coordinates and triangle data, then preparing the data for OBJ format. The program reads the STL file provided by the user and processes the data to generate an OBJ file.

## Usage

1. **Input STL File**: Provide the path to the STL file you want to convert to OBJ.

2. **Conversion Process**: The program will convert the STL file into OBJ format.

3. **Output OBJ File**: The resulting OBJ file will be saved in the same directory.

## Implementation Details

- **Language and Environment**: Implemented in Visual Studio using C#.
- **Data Extraction**: Vertex coordinates and triangle data are extracted from the STL file during the conversion process.
- **Format Preparation**: The extracted data is processed and prepared for OBJ format.
- **Input Handling**: The program accepts user-provided STL files for conversion.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio
- Knowledge of C# programming language
- Understanding of STL and OBJ file formats
- Familiarity with file parsing and data manipulation in C#
