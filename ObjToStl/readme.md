# OBJ to STL Converter

This program converts OBJ files into STL format and saves the output into an STL file.

## Description

This assignment deals with converting OBJ files into STL format and storing the output into an STL file. The converter takes the path to the OBJ file as input, converts it into STL format, and saves the resulting STL file. The conversion process involves storing vertex coordinates and triangle data, then performing triangulation to prepare the data for STL format. The program reads the OBJ file provided by the user and stores the data into a triangulation before converting it into the STL file format.

## Usage

1. **Input OBJ File**: Provide the path to the OBJ file you want to convert to STL.

2. **Conversion Process**: The program will convert the OBJ file into STL format.

3. **Output STL File**: The resulting STL file will be saved in the same directory.

## Implementation Details

- **Language and Environment**: Implemented in Visual Studio using C#.
- **Data Storage**: Vertex coordinates and triangle data are stored during the conversion process.
- **Triangulation**: All OBJ file triangle data is processed and prepared for STL format.
- **Input Handling**: The program accepts user-provided OBJ files for conversion.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio
- Knowledge of C# programming language
- Understanding of OBJ and STL file formats
- Familiarity with triangulation algorithms
